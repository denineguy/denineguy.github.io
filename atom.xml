    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This week I was asked a question that kind of stumped me.  How does the Internet work?  I had an idea of how it works, but I didn&rsquo;t know the correct terminology to correctly articulate.  It got me thinking, how does the Internet actually work? In this post I attempt to explain how it works at it&rsquo;s most basic level</p>

<!-- more -->


<h2>What is the Internet</h2>

<p>The Internet is essentially a wire that is actually buried underground.  It may be fiber optic wire cables or sometimes beamed to satellites or cell phone networks but it is essentially a wire. The Internet, as I am sure you all know, is useful because two computers connected to this wire can communicate with each other.  A server is a computer connected directly to the Internet and a web page is essentially a file that is stored on that server’s hard drive.</p>

<h2>How to render a Webpage</h2>

<p>So say you are on your computer and you want to go to the google.com webpage.  You would type in www.google.com and voila a webpage would render&hellip;but how does that happen? Well your computer is a client because it does not directly connect to the Internet.  It connects to the Internet through and Internet Service Provider, using DSL. To get to google.com webpage, which is and ISP and a server, a lot happens on the backend. Let&rsquo;s first take a look at protocols</p>

<h2>Protocols</h2>

<p>Protocols are sets of rules that machines follow to complete tasks. Two of the most important protocols for the web are TCP/IP, which defines how electronic devices (like computers) should be connected over the Internet, and how data should be transmitted between them.</p>

<ol>
<li>TCP &ndash; transmission control protocol

<ul>
<li>TCP breaks down every piece of data into packets, because a webpage is too large to transfer over the Internet all at once.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>IP is Internet protocol

<ul>
<li>IP address is specific to each device that is connected to the Internet and it is how one machine can find another machine through the network</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>


<p>The TCP/IP protocols are usually used together and they are basically the rules for how information is passed through the Internet. When you want to send a message or retrieve information from another computer TCP/IP is what makes this possible. One of the most common types protocols for the web is Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), which takes care of the communication between the web server and the web browser.  It is used for sending information from the client (browser) to the web server and then returning the web content back from the web server to the client.</p>

<h2>Sending and Retrieving Information</h2>

<p>As stated previously, when I type in google.com a request is sent to the Internet Service Provider, which routes the request to the server. It first hits the domain name server (DNS), which looks at the domain name typed in (such as www.google.com) and then searches for the correct IP address associated with that Domain Name.  The DNS will then point that request in the correct direction.   Once it hits the target server, in our case it would be the server for Google, the server will respond by sending the files back to your computer in a series of packets.  The packets are about 1000 – 1500 bytes and have header and footer telling what information is in the packet and how it fits in with the entire file, along with the IP address.  Note that the packets don&rsquo;t all follow the same path back because they are looking for the quickest route back to the client.  Routers direct the packets around the Internet helping them reach your computer.   Each router examines the destination addresses and contents of the packets it receives and then passes the packets on to another router as they make their way to their final destination (your computer). Once they get to the client TCP comes into play again and puts the packets back together based on the information stored in that packet, whether that be an image, an email message or even a tweet. HTTP helps to return the web content to the browser.  The Hypertext Markup Language (HTML), in the files, tells the Web browser how to display the page and its element and thus google.com webpage is rendered.</p>

<p>So this is very basic, but it is in essence how the Internet works.  Learning this was very helpful to me and I hope that is will be of use to you.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Last week I had the pleasure of attending a Women Who Code NYC event focusing on Algorithms &amp;Interview Prep. The meetup provided a lot of great resources for interview prep and gave us all a chance to work on our whiteboarding skills. One of the questions we came across was regarding   Apple Stock.</p>

<!-- more -->


<h2>Apple Stock Question</h2>

<p>I have an array of stock_prices where the keys are the number of minutes into the day (starting with midnight) and the values are the price of Apple stock at that time.  For example, the stock cost $500 at 1am, so stockPricesYesterday[60] = 500.
Write an efficient algorithm for computing the best profit I could have made from 1 purchase and 1 sale of an Apple stock yesterday.</p>

<h2>First Solution</h2>

<p>My first attempt at solving this was the brute force way, which iterates through all of the possible solutions.  While this will give me the answer the issue is that it there are n<sup>2</sup> combinations (where n represents each time and stock price pair, for the day). This result will take O(n<sup>2</sup>) time to get to the solution. Below is an example of my solution.</p>

</span><span class='line'>  <span class="k">end</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<h2>Second Solution &ndash; The Greedy Method</h2>

<p>My next solution was iterating through the stock prices only once to look for the optimal solution.  This is done using the greedy method. A greedy algorithm iterates through the problem space taking the optimal solution &ldquo;so far,&rdquo; until it reaches the end. This method leads to only iterating through the problem n times and gives a solution that is O(n) times fast.</p>

<h2>More About the Greedy Method</h2>

<p>In general, greedy algorithms have five components:</p>

<ol>
<li>A candidate set, from which a solution is created</li>
<li>A selection function, which chooses the best candidate to be added to the solution</li>
<li>A feasibility function, that is used to determine if a candidate can be used to contribute to a solution</li>
<li>An objective function, which assigns a value to a solution, or a partial solution, and</li>
<li>A solution function, which will indicate when we have discovered a complete solution</li>
</ol>


<p>Greedy algorithms help find the optimal solution for some mathematical problems, but not all. This algorithm works best on problems that have two properties:</p>

<h3>Greedy choice property</h3>

<p>We can make whatever choice seems best at the moment and then solve the subproblems that
arise later. The choice made by a greedy algorithm may depend on choices made so far but
not on future choices or all the solutions to the subproblem. It iteratively makes one
greedy choice after another, reducing each given problem into a smaller one. In other words,
a greedy algorithm never reconsiders its choices.</p>

<h3>Optimal substructure</h3>

<p>&ldquo;A problem exhibits optimal substructure if an optimal solution to the problem contains
ptimal solutions to the sub-problems.&rdquo;</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Having spent the last 7 weeks learning Ruby and Ruby on Rails I am slowly beginning to understand its magic and how quickly a web application can be built using Rails.  With this in mind I wanted to better understand why others think this web-application framework is so hot and more importantly I wanted to know what is the growth trend for Ruby on Rails and what companies are using this technology for web applications.  Hey let’s be serious I want to ensure the prospects of finding a job after learning this are feasible.</p>

<!-- more -->


<h2>Why Ruby on Rails is Hot</h2>

<p>Ruby on Rails (RoR) is an open source web application framework written with the Ruby Programming language. It is said that the speed and agility with which applications can be built with Ruby on Rails, results in increased productivity and company growth.  The versatility and speed of Ruby makes it possible to build custom software for app development, allowing businesses have to differentiate themselves, while also creating functional software that makes data collection, visualization and exchange fast and efficient.  Lastly, Ruby on Rails is known to be simpler and cheaper than other traditional web development processes.</p>

<h2>Website Usage and Industry Trends</h2>

<p>All companies ranging from startups to large multinational corporation have begun to realize how fast and effective building web apps with Ruby on Rails is.  As such more companies are using the web frameworking.  According to one estimate there are, over <a href="http://trends.builtwith.com/framework/Ruby-on-Rails" title="Title">600,000</a> websites are running on Ruby on Rails.  Over the past year the number of sites running on Ruby on Rails has increased by approximately 20%.</p>

<h4>Websites Using Rails: Growth Trend</h4>

<p><img src="http://denineguy.github.io/images/growth_trend_rails.png" title="Yearly Growth trend for websites using Ruby on Rails" alt="Websites Using Rails: Growth Trend" /></p>

<p>The below image shows the Top Million websites using Ruby on Rails, broken down into segments. (Top 10k sites, Top 100k site and Top Million sites).  There are approximately 230 sites of the top 10k sites that are currently using Ruby on Rails</p>

    <link href="http://denineguy.github.io/blog/2014/07/02/generating-passwords/"/>
    <updated>2014-07-02T00:08:45-04:00</updated>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2>Web Applications with Sinatra</h2>

<p>Over the past week, at The Flatiron School we have been learning about Rack and creating web applications using Sinatra.  Sinatra is a free open source software web application library, that is a domain-specific language written in Ruby, and is dependent on the Rack web service interface.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>Unlike Ruby on Rails, Sinatra does not follow the typical model-view-controller pattern.  Instead it focuses on quickly creating web applications in Ruby with minimal effort.  After further reading, I discovered that Sinatra is great for creating small apps and is ideal if your controller structure can fit into one or two pages of code. With this in mind, I decided to set it out and try to create my own app.</p>

<h2>My Hatred for Passwords</h2>

<p>I love the internet, always have and always will, but there is one thing in particular that has become increasingly annoying to me and that is the need for passwords on nearly every site.  I mean it has gotten so bad that some companies don’t even let you peruse their site to figure out what they are all about without having to sign in. We know nothing about them but to learn more they have to capture data on us.  I personally think this should be illegal but that is neither here not there.  The reality of the situation is that I can’t keep up with these passwords anymore.  It was so bad at one point that I literally had the same password for every site.  YES I know that is bad, but I just couldn’t think of any better passwords.  I have since started changing them, but am running out of ideas for passwords.  Since it doesn’t seem like the need for passwords on websites are going away anytime soon, I decided to see if I could create a random password generator for myself&hellip;  that is until I figure out a better technology to eliminate the need for passwords altogether.</p>

<p>Please note that my password generator does not produce the most secure passwords at this time.  This is a work in progress and I will continue to develop this app.</p>

<p>First things I didn’t want an extremly abstract password that I wouldn’t remember.  I thought if I set two words that I could manipulate, maybe I will rememeber them a little better. Above is a form that would take in two words of my choice.</p>

<p>I then created a Password Class that takes in two words and permutates them. I randomly select a permutation of 2-4 characters for the first word out of several different permutations, and 1-3 characters for the second word.   I then join the two words with random numbers, and a non-word character, which will ultimately generate my password.</p>

<p>This code above shows my routes, the HTTP method (GET or POST) with the corresponding URL destination when a request is made to the server.  The root goes to my index page.  When the link on the index page is clicked it takes the user to a word generator form page, where the user has to enter two words and click submit. This will ultimately end up on the password page which will show them their newly created password. If a user does not like that password they can either refresh page to generate a new password permutation or go back to the word_generator from and submit two new words to create an entirely new password.</p>

<p>Voila and there it is my very own randomly generated password. <em> pp7sar_10 </em></p>

<p>Well this is my app.  I will continue to improve this app and hope to have it deployed shortly.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Ruby is an object oriented programming language modeled around objects rather than &ldquo;actions&rdquo; and data rather than logic. Ruby allows you to define a class that provides a blueprint for the construction of similar objects.</p>

<!-- more -->


<h2>What is a Class</h2>

<p>A class is a way of organizing and providing a blueprint for producing objects with similar attributes and methods.  It should have a single responsibility and its purpose is to define the behavior of an object.  Ruby has several built in classes such as the String Class, Array Class, Integer Class, Hash Class and many more.  Ruby also allows one to define and create your own classes.</p>

<h2>Creating Classes</h2>

<p>A class is defined by the keyword class, the class name, a constant, beginning with a capital letter and followed by the word end. Below is an example of the syntax:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">Person</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="k">end</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<h2>Class Objects</h2>

<p>An object is thought of as an instance of the class. in Ruby you can create an object or instance of the class by using the new method, as follow:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="n">girl</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="no">Person</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">new</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;Lisa&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="n">boy</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="no">Person</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">new</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;Gene&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<h2>Variable Scope</h2>

<p>Ruby offers 4 types of variables</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Local Variables: Local variable are variables that are defined in a method and not available outside of the method.  Local variables begin with a lower case letter or _.<code>local</code> or <code>_local</code></p></li>
<li><p>Instance Variables: Instance variables are available across methods for any particular instance or object. That means that instance variables change from object to object. Instance variables are preceded by the at sign (@) followed by the variable name. <code>@variable</code></p></li>
<li><p>Class Variables: Class variables are available across different objects. A class variable belongs to the class and is a characteristic of a class. They are preceded by the sign @@ and are followed by the variable name. <code>@@class</code></p></li>
<li><p>Global Variables: Class variables are not available across classes. If you want to have a single variable, which is available across classes, you need to define a global variable. The global variables are always preceded by the dollar sign ($). <code>$global</code></p></li>
</ul>


<h2>New vs Initialize method</h2>

<p>Initialize is a method of the instance that is used to boot up the object once it has been created.  New is a method of the class and is used to create the instance.  When &ldquo;new&rdquo; is called it creates an instance of the class and triggers the initalize method, which tells the object what to do as soon as it is created.   So if I call Person.new it will trigger the initialize method and take in the person name and job and the person will automatically say Hello my name is Danielle.</p>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<h2>Instance vs Class Methods</h2>

<p>Instance methods on the other hand are methods of the instance or object. The speak method above is an example of an instance method. In my example the Instance method defines what a person does when they speak.  Class methods are declared the same way as instance methods, except that they are prefixed by self, or the class name, followed by a period. These methods are executed at the Class level and may be called without an object instance. They cannot access instance variables but do have access to class variables. Below is an example of class methods</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">Person</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nc">Person</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="nf">find_by_name</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="c1">#do something</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="k">end</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="k">end</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>This is can also be written using self which is the preferred method for Ruby.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">Person</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nc">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="nf">find_by_age</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="c1">#do something </span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="k">end</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="k">end</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<h2>Attribute Reader Write and Accessor Methods</h2>

<p>An object&rsquo;s instance variables are its attributes, which distinguish one object from other objects of the same class. It is important to be able to write to and read these attributes; doing so requires methods called attribute accessors.  We can use as attr_reader to access a variable and and attr_writer to change it.</p>

<p>This can also be written more concisely with attr_reader and attr_writer methods which automatically creates the setter and getter methods respectively.</p>

<p>When there is a variable that is both an attr_reader and attr_writer it can be written even more succinctly with an attr_accessor method as follows.</p>

<h2>Inheritance</h2>

<p>Inheritance is the process by which one class takes on the attributes and methods of another class, the parent class.  Inheritance creates a relationship such that if one object cannot respond to a message it delegates that message to another object.  It should be noted that Ruby does not support multiple inheritance and so a class in Ruby can have only one base or parent class. The The syntax for inheritance is the Derived class, the new class which inherits from the base or parent class.</p>
