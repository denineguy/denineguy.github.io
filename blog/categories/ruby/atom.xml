    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Last week I had the pleasure of attending a Women Who Code NYC event focusing on Algorithms &amp;Interview Prep. The meetup provided a lot of great resources for interview prep and gave us all a chance to work on our whiteboarding skills. One of the questions we came across was regarding   Apple Stock.</p>

<!-- more -->


<h2>Apple Stock Question</h2>

<p>I have an array of stock_prices where the keys are the number of minutes into the day (starting with midnight) and the values are the price of Apple stock at that time.  For example, the stock cost $500 at 1am, so stockPricesYesterday[60] = 500.
Write an efficient algorithm for computing the best profit I could have made from 1 purchase and 1 sale of an Apple stock yesterday.</p>

<h2>First Solution</h2>

<p>My first attempt at solving this was the brute force way, which iterates through all of the possible solutions.  While this will give me the answer the issue is that it there are n<sup>2</sup> combinations (where n represents each time and stock price pair, for the day). This result will take O(n<sup>2</sup>) time to get to the solution. Below is an example of my solution.</p>

<p>```ruby Brute Force Apple Stock Solution
  class StockMarket</p>

<pre><code>def apple_stock(stock_prices)
  max_profit = 0

  stock_prices.each_with_index do |buy_price, buy_time|
    stock_prices.each_with_index do |sell_price, sell_time|
      profit = sell_price - buy_price
      if buy_time &lt; sell_time &amp;&amp; profit &gt; max_profit
        max_profit = profit
      end
    end x
  end
  return max_profit

end
</code></pre>

<p>  end
```</p>

<h2>Second Solution &ndash; The Greedy Method</h2>

<p>My next solution was iterating through the stock prices only once to look for the optimal solution.  This is done using the greedy method. A greedy algorithm iterates through the problem space taking the optimal solution &ldquo;so far,&rdquo; until it reaches the end. This method leads to only iterating through the problem n times and gives a solution that is O(n) times fast.</p>

<p>```ruby Greedy Method Apple Stock Solution
class StockMarket
  def apple_stock(stock_prices)</p>

<pre><code>max_profit = 0,
min_price = stock_prices[0]

0.upto(stock_prices.length - 1) do |time|   
  current_price = stock_prices[time]
  min_price = current_price  if current_price &lt; min_price

  current_profit = current_price - min_price
  max_profit = current_profit if current_profit &gt; max_profit[0]
end
max_profit
</code></pre>

<p>  end
end
```</p>

<h2>More About the Greedy Method</h2>

<p>In general, greedy algorithms have five components:</p>

<ol>
<li>A candidate set, from which a solution is created</li>
<li>A selection function, which chooses the best candidate to be added to the solution</li>
<li>A feasibility function, that is used to determine if a candidate can be used to contribute to a solution</li>
<li>An objective function, which assigns a value to a solution, or a partial solution, and</li>
<li>A solution function, which will indicate when we have discovered a complete solution</li>
</ol>


<p>Greedy algorithms help find the optimal solution for some mathematical problems, but not all. This algorithm works best on problems that have two properties:</p>

<h3>Greedy choice property</h3>

<p>We can make whatever choice seems best at the moment and then solve the subproblems that
arise later. The choice made by a greedy algorithm may depend on choices made so far but
not on future choices or all the solutions to the subproblem. It iteratively makes one
greedy choice after another, reducing each given problem into a smaller one. In other words,
a greedy algorithm never reconsiders its choices.</p>

<h3>Optimal substructure</h3>

<p>&ldquo;A problem exhibits optimal substructure if an optimal solution to the problem contains
ptimal solutions to the sub-problems.&rdquo;</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Having spent the last 7 weeks learning Ruby and Ruby on Rails I am slowly beginning to understand its magic and how quickly a web application can be built using Rails.  With this in mind I wanted to better understand why others think this web-application framework is so hot and more importantly I wanted to know what is the growth trend for Ruby on Rails and what companies are using this technology for web applications.  Hey let’s be serious I want to ensure the prospects of finding a job after learning this are feasible.</p>

<!-- more -->


<h2>Why Ruby on Rails is Hot</h2>

<p>Ruby on Rails (RoR) is an open source web application framework written with the Ruby Programming language. It is said that the speed and agility with which applications can be built with Ruby on Rails, results in increased productivity and company growth.  The versatility and speed of Ruby makes it possible to build custom software for app development, allowing businesses have to differentiate themselves, while also creating functional software that makes data collection, visualization and exchange fast and efficient.  Lastly, Ruby on Rails is known to be simpler and cheaper than other traditional web development processes.</p>

<h2>Website Usage and Industry Trends</h2>

<p>All companies ranging from startups to large multinational corporation have begun to realize how fast and effective building web apps with Ruby on Rails is.  As such more companies are using the web frameworking.  According to one estimate there are, over <a href="http://trends.builtwith.com/framework/Ruby-on-Rails" title="Title">600,000</a> websites are running on Ruby on Rails.  Over the past year the number of sites running on Ruby on Rails has increased by approximately 20%.</p>

<h4>Websites Using Rails: Growth Trend</h4>

<p><img src="/images/growth_trend_rails.png" title="Yearly Growth trend for websites using Ruby on Rails" alt="Websites Using Rails: Growth Trend" /></p>

<p>The below image shows the Top Million websites using Ruby on Rails, broken down into segments. (Top 10k sites, Top 100k site and Top Million sites).  There are approximately 230 sites of the top 10k sites that are currently using Ruby on Rails</p>

<h4>Number of Websites Using Ruby on Rails out of Top Million Sites</h4>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2>Web Applications with Sinatra</h2>

<p>Over the past week, at The Flatiron School we have been learning about Rack and creating web applications using Sinatra.  Sinatra is a free open source software web application library, that is a domain-specific language written in Ruby, and is dependent on the Rack web service interface.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>Unlike Ruby on Rails, Sinatra does not follow the typical model-view-controller pattern.  Instead it focuses on quickly creating web applications in Ruby with minimal effort.  After further reading, I discovered that Sinatra is great for creating small apps and is ideal if your controller structure can fit into one or two pages of code. With this in mind, I decided to set it out and try to create my own app.</p>

<h2>My Hatred for Passwords</h2>

<p>I love the internet, always have and always will, but there is one thing in particular that has become increasingly annoying to me and that is the need for passwords on nearly every site.  I mean it has gotten so bad that some companies don’t even let you peruse their site to figure out what they are all about without having to sign in. We know nothing about them but to learn more they have to capture data on us.  I personally think this should be illegal but that is neither here not there.  The reality of the situation is that I can’t keep up with these passwords anymore.  It was so bad at one point that I literally had the same password for every site.  YES I know that is bad, but I just couldn’t think of any better passwords.  I have since started changing them, but am running out of ideas for passwords.  Since it doesn’t seem like the need for passwords on websites are going away anytime soon, I decided to see if I could create a random password generator for myself&hellip;  that is until I figure out a better technology to eliminate the need for passwords altogether.</p>

<p>Please note that my password generator does not produce the most secure passwords at this time.  This is a work in progress and I will continue to develop this app.</p>

<h2>Word-Generator Form</h2>

<p>```html
<form action='/password' method="POST"></p>

<h3>Please enter two words that are at least 5 letters long</h3>


<p>  <p></p>

<pre><code>&lt;label for="first_word"&gt;First Word:&lt;/label&gt;
&lt;input id="first_word" type="text" name="password[first_word]"&gt; &lt;/br&gt; 
&lt;label for="second_word"&gt;Second Word:&lt;/label&gt;
&lt;input id="second_word" type="text" name="password[second_word]"&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>  </p>
  <input type="submit" value="submit"/>
</form>
```</p>

<p>First things I didn’t want an extremly abstract password that I wouldn’t remember.  I thought if I set two words that I could manipulate, maybe I will rememeber them a little better. Above is a form that would take in two words of my choice.</p>

<h2>Class Password</h2>

<p>```ruby
require &lsquo;sinatra&rsquo;
class Password</p>

<p>  attr_accessor :first_word, :second_word, :password_generator</p>

<p>  def initialize</p>

<pre><code>@generator = []
</code></pre>

<p>  end</p>

<p>  def word1</p>

<pre><code>word_split = first_word.split("")
scramble = word_split.permutation(rand(2..4)).to_a[rand(30)]
</code></pre>

<p>  end</p>

<p>  def word2</p>

<pre><code>word_split = second_word.split("")
scramble = word_split.permutation(rand(2..3)).to_a[rand(20)]
</code></pre>

<p>  end</p>

<p>  def password_generator</p>

<pre><code>@generator &lt;&lt; [word1, rand(10), word2, "_", rand(20)].join
@generator[0]
</code></pre>

<p>  end</p>

<p>end
```
I then created a Password Class that takes in two words and permutates them. I randomly select a permutation of 2-4 characters for the first word out of several different permutations, and 1-3 characters for the second word.   I then join the two words with random numbers, and a non-word character, which will ultimately generate my password.</p>

<h2>App.rb &ndash; Routes</h2>

<p>```ruby
module PasswordSinatra
  class App &lt; Sinatra::Base</p>

<pre><code>get '/' do
  erb :index
end

get '/word_generator' do
   erb :word_generator 
end

post '/password' do
  @password = Password.new
  @password.first_word = params[:password][:first_word]
  @password.second_word = params[:password][:second_word]
  @password.password_generator = params[:password][:password_generator]

  erb :password
end

get '/password' do
  erb :word_generator
end
</code></pre>

<p>  end
end
```
This code above shows my routes, the HTTP method (GET or POST) with the corresponding URL destination when a request is made to the server.  The root goes to my index page.  When the link on the index page is clicked it takes the user to a word generator form page, where the user has to enter two words and click submit. This will ultimately end up on the password page which will show them their newly created password. If a user does not like that password they can either refresh page to generate a new password permutation or go back to the word_generator from and submit two new words to create an entirely new password.</p>

<h2>Screenshots of the Password Generator Application</h2>

<p>Voila and there it is my very own randomly generated password. <em> pp7sar_10 </em></p>

<p>Well this is my app.  I will continue to improve this app and hope to have it deployed shortly.</p>
